**Why this matters:** In local review analysis, roughly **40% of 5-star reviews** for independent nurseries mention *knowledgeable staff* and helpful advice.
That means better-trained staff directly correlates to reputation, repeat visits, and increased sales.  
Our audio series makes it easy to hone those skills â€” quick, practical lessons staff can listen to between tasks.

- **Customer-facing spin-offs:** short 60â€“90 second audio clips you can link with QR codes to plant tags or receipts.
- **Low friction:** no app installs for staff â€” play in break rooms, on a POS tablet, or push to internal comms.

### Next steps you can offer the manager
1. Ask for a 10-minute demo (we can play 2 episodes and show how QR care tips work).  
2. Offer a 30-day pilot for a single location at a reduced rate to prove ROI.  
3. Provide branded intros (nursery name and contact) on each episode for a white-label feel.

If you'd like, include a link to a PDF one-sheet, or ask us to prepare an example QR tag for a top-selling plant.
